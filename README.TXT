I have had many, many requests from M68HC11 users over the 
years for the source code for BASIC11. I was very reluctant to 
release the source code for a number of reasons. First, because 
BASIC11 was nothing more than a skunk works project, most of 
the programming was done late at night and on weekends. 
Consequently, no documentation exists on the internal operation 
of the interpreter and proper source code documentation 
practices were completely ignored. I would not approach a 
project like this in a similar manner today.

Second, because my job as a Field Applications Engineer is to 
provide support to a specific group of customers, I feared that 
releasing the source code would produce an avalanche of support 
questions that I would not have time to answer. In turn this 
might upset the customers whose questions I could not answer.

However, after much consideration, I have decided to release 
the BASIC11 source code to the public. Please understand that I 
cannot provide any help or assistance in adapting BASIC11 to 
another hardware environment or provide help in understanding 
the internal workings of BASIC11. You're on your own.
